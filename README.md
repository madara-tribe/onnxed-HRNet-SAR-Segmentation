# HRNet-SAR-Segmentation


# abstract

semantic segmentation for in SAR(synthetic aperture radar) images which is took from satelliate.

1 SAR image has VV and HV type.

## HRNet

The high-resolution network (HRNet) is a universal architecture for visual recognition.

is a general purpose convolutional neural network for tasks like semantic segmentation, object detection and image classification. It is able to maintain high resolution representations through the whole process
